Hi, I am Janaky Murthy. Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this blog to write about stuff that I find interesting. 

**About me:** I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [Ati Motors, Bangalore](https://www.atimotors.com/). Previously I completed Masters (by Research) from the [CSA Department, IISc Bangalore](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) where I was supervised by [Prof. Chandan Saha](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chandan/). Prior to that I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Government Engineering College, Rajkot](http://www.gecrj.cteguj.in/). I have a general interest in solving problems, math and CS. In a parallel universe I enjoy listening to music, [folding paper](https://www.instagram.com/foolishjan/) and writing with my [fountain pen(s)](https://github.com/JanakyMurthy/Fountain-Pen-Models).

**Research Interests:** My general interests includes Algorithms, Complexity Theory and Machine Learning. Currently, I am exploring various sub areas to identify interesting problems that I would like to work on. 

**Masters Thesis:** Equivalence test for the trace iterated matrix multiplication polynomial [Thesis](/masters-thesis.pdf), [Slides](/masters-slides.pdf).

**Publications:** Check out my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KGr8yQQAAAAJ&hl=en).
